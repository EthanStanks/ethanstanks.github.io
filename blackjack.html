        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I completed a project that involved developing a C# Console Window application that included a BlackjackGame class with fields for the dealer hand, player hand, and deck of cards. The game logic was implemented through various methods such as initial card dealing, player's turn, dealer's turn, declaring a winner, and drawing the game table. I also challenged myself by creating a multiple player version of the game with betting functionality.
