								<h1>Ethan Stanks</h1>
								<p><u>Hi there!</u> I'm thrilled to share a little bit about myself with you. I'm currently pursuing my <b>BA in Computer Science with a focus on AI</b> at <b>Full Sail University</b>, where I also earned my <b>associates degree in Computer Science</b>.</p>
								<p>My passion for technology goes beyond academics. When I'm not immersed in coursework or working on tech projects, you'll most likely find me gaming. I'm a big fan of FPS, Sandbox, Dungeon Crawlers, and Multiplayer Party Games. If you're looking for a gaming buddy, count me in!</p>
								<p>Aside from gaming, I also love playing chess and watching movies. But my true love is technology. I'm constantly exploring new concepts and ideas, particularly in areas like Machine Learning AI, C++ video game programming, Android app development, and network programming. I'm excited to see where the future of technology takes us!</p>

									<h2>Cranny Android App</h2>
									In the first month, I focused on creating the <strong>social page</strong>, including a feed to showcase friends' recently read books and profile information. Additionally, I implemented <strong>Firebase's Google authentication</strong> for the login page and created classes for seamless <strong>CRUD operations on Firebase</strong>.</p><ul class="actions">

									<h2>Winsock Chat Room</h2>
									<p>Using the Winsock API, I developed a chatroom project featuring a <strong>client/server architecture</strong> with support for both <strong>TCP and UDP protocols</strong>. The server utilizes a <strong>non-blocking multiplexed TCP socket</strong> and broadcasts TCP information using UDP <strong>every second</strong>. The client connects to the server through TCP after <strong>receiving the UDP broadcast</strong>. Additionally, the client is <strong>multithreaded</strong>, with the <strong>TCP receiver running on a detached thread</strong> and the <strong>TCP sender running on the main thread</strong>.</p>

									<h2>Game Engine Development</h2>
									<p>As part of my project, I <strong>developed a basic C++ game engine</strong> that incorporated a provided <strong>DirectX renderer</strong>. My responsibilities included creating a <strong>simple yet efficient particle system</strong>, which utilized a <strong>free and sorted pool</strong> to manage its memory. Furthermore, I <strong>implemented camera movement</strong>, <strong>drew AABBs (axis-aligned bounding boxes)</strong>, <strong>calculated and drew frustum planes and points</strong>, and <strong>managed keyboard and mouse input</strong> using <strong>Windows input messaging</strong>.</p>

									<h2>Vulkan Renderer</h2>
									<p>My Vulkan renderer class project is a graphics renderer created in Vulkan using an Object Oriented approach to Data Driven Rendering. The goal is to draw the visual aspects of a game level using the Vulkan API. The project features <strong>intuitive controls</strong> and a range of impressive capabilities, including support for <strong>exporting OBJ names and locations from Blender Game Levels</strong>, <strong>run-time file I/O parsing of exported level information</strong>, and the ability to draw all models successfully at the proper location, orientation, and scale. Additional features include <strong>directional light with ambient term and specular highlights</strong>, support for <strong>hot-swapping multiple levels without a restart</strong>, and <strong>credits to low-poly models from Quaternius</strong>. Overall, my Vulkan renderer class project is a testament to my skills in computer graphics and game development.</p>

									<h2>Forecast Armageddon</h2>
									<p>As part of a team, I developed a 3D tower defense game using the Unity engine. The game utilizes a unique <strong>card conveyor belt and weather system</strong> to defend against enemy waves across three distinct maps. My main responsibilities included creating all <strong>UI systems and elements</strong>, as well as designing and implementing the <strong>card system</strong>. This card system features a variety of cards, each with different towers, weather effects, buffs, and traps. By incorporating cards, the game provides a range of outcomes for each playthrough and increases its overall replayability.</p>

									<h2>Black Jack</h2>
									<p>I completed a project that involved developing a <strong>C# Console Window application</strong> that included a <strong>BlackjackGame class</strong> with fields for the dealer hand, player hand, and deck of cards. The game logic was implemented through various methods such as initial card dealing, player's turn, dealer's turn, declaring a winner, and drawing the game table. I also challenged myself by creating a <strong>multiple player version</strong> of the game with <strong>betting functionality</strong>.</p>
