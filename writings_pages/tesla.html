                This report covers Tesla’s advancements in full-self-driving
                (FSD) capabilities, focusing on their efforts in developing a safe
                navigation and obstacle avoidance system. Tesla stands as one of
                the top companies racing to achieve FSD, utilizing complex
                artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The goal is to highlight Tesla’s
                approach to overcoming challenges brought to autonomous driving
                and how they make sure their FSD can be safe for all drivers on
                the road. Tesla’s use of neural networks per camera allows it to
                analyze raw images trained on the most complicated scenarios
                from millions of customers’ vehicles in real time. Each sensor
                creates accurate and large-scale models to build a decision-making
                system for real driving situations. With FSD developing under
                Tesla, a publicly traded company, the people have control over
                ensuring that a safer future is achievable on the road with AI
