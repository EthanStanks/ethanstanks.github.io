        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A graphics renderer created in Vulkan using an Object Oriented approach to Data Driven Rendering. The goal is to draw the visual aspects of a game level using the Vulkan API. The project features intuitive controls and a range of impressive capabilities, including support for exporting OBJ names and locations from Blender Game Levels, run-time file I/O parsing of exported level information, and the ability to draw all models successfully at the proper location, orientation, and scale. Additional features include directional light with ambient term and specular highlights, support for hot-swapping multiple levels without a restart, and credits to low-poly models from Quaternius.
