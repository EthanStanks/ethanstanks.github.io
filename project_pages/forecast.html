            <p class = "description-text">As part of a team, I developed a 3D tower defense game using the Unity engine. The game utilizes a unique card conveyor belt and weather system to defend against enemy waves across three distinct maps. My main responsibilities included creating all UI systems and elements, as well as designing and implementing the card system. This card system features a variety of cards, each with different towers, weather effects, buffs, and traps. By incorporating cards, the game provides a range of outcomes for each playthrough and increases its overall replayability.</p>
