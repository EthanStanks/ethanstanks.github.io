                Hello there, my name is Ethan! As of writing this, I am 20 years old and started my journey at Full Sail University in 2021.
                My original degree path was the Game Development Computer Science program, but wanting to explore more opportunities in computer science led me to the Artificial Intelligence concentration.<br />
                I have always been involved with technology from a very young age. I first heard about Full Sail University in a game magazine when I was 10 years old. I ripped out the flyer and kept it as a reminder of what I wanted to do!
                After going through the entire game development course and now the artificial intelligence course, I'm finally ready to finish off my bachelor's studies.<br />
                The purpose of these blogs is to document my progress during my four-month-long capstone project that I will be working on with a team.
                My goal is to have an end product that I am proud of and that has some innovation built in. I don't want to have a generic project as my last one, but something exciting and new that will highlight my work here at Full Sail University.<br />

                My team and I are currently wrapping up week two of our first month. Last week, we decided on a project idea out of the three of our pitches. Will's Pitch is an artificial intelligence anti-virus for detecting malicious threats in the firewall. Temitayo's pitch is a machine learning GANs model that generates realistic faces from prompts using NLP. My pitch is an Android app that uses machine learning to recommend recipes based on user feedback and the ingredients in their kitchen. We all agreed that Temitayo's realistic face GANs model would be a perfect project to finish off our degree and showcase our abilities.<br />
                This week, the team and I got together to create the first draft for our project's design document and style tile. The style tile allows us to get the look and feel of our application without committing to it. The style tile includes the colors, typefaces, icons, user interface, and photography of how we plan on designing our wireframe for next week.<br />
                The design document went over our project's purpose, goals, requirements, development environments, use cases, and production plans. As of now, the model is set to be developed in PyTorch. Only Temitayo has experience in PyTorch, but Will and I wanted to be exposed to it as we only have experience in TensorFlow. The back-end will be developed with Django. The front-end will be developed with React. I have no experience with any of these tools, but a handyman shouldn't only know how to use a hammer but all the tools in his toolbox. With that being said, I told the team I'd like to take on the role of front-end with React.<br />
                The following days, after creating the first draft for the design document, I explored LinkedIn Learning to get a feel for React. I have completed two courses as of right now to get me ready for the first month of development next month. The first course covered the basics, like creating new components, setting up development tools in Chrome, using built-in hooks, and setting up test cases. The second course has me creating a React app from the ground up, using built-in hooks, and setting up more test cases. For the next two weeks of month one, I plan on continuing my research with React to further my front-end abilities.<br />
