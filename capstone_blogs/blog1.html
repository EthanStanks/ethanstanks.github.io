            Hello there, my name is Ethan! As of writing this, I am 20 years old and started my journey at Full Sail University in 2021.<br>
            My original degree path was the Game Development Computer Science program, but wanting to explore more opportunities in computer science led me to the Artificial Intelligence concentration.<br>
            I have always been involved with technology from a very young age. I first heard about Full Sail University in a game magazine when I was 10 years old. I ripped out the flyer and kept it as a reminder of what I wanted to do!<br>
            After going through the entire game development course and now the artificial intelligence course, I'm finally ready to finish off my bachelor's studies.<br>
            The purpose of these blogs is to document my progress during my five-month-long capstone project that I will be working on with a team.<br>
            My goal is to have an end product that I am proud of and that has some innovation built in. I don't want to have a generic project as my last one, but something exciting and new that will highlight my work here at Full Sail University.<br>
