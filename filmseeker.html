        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            FilmSeeker uses NLP techniques to recommend movies based off of movie descriptions. This project was completed in a couple days. I took on this project to practice what I had learned in my NLP class December 2023. I had planned for implementing this model into a Discord application, but at the time their is an issue on Discord's side not allowing me to create a new application. For the time being I made it into a simple command prompt interface.
